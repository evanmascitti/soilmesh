This package houses the functions I use for processing 3D meshes in ASI 468. This code has been kept separate from that in **diRtscience** because the mesh processing is very specific to my project, and it is not likely anyone else would need to use the functions in this package. I do plan to publish **diRtscience** on CRAN, so I want to be a good curator of that package and keep my niche stuff out of it.
