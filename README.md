This package houses the functions I use for processing 3D meshes in ASI
468. As of 2020-11-07 it holds a single function for clipping meshes to
just the soil surface.

I plan to add additional functions for auto-aligning meshes and
analyzing their geometry. THe goal is for there to be zero
point-and-click in the pipeline; this ensures complete reproducibility
of my analyses.

This package has been kept separate from that in **diRtscience** because
the mesh processing methods are very specific to my project, and it is
not likely anyone else would need to use the functions residing in
**soilmesh**. I do plan to publish **diRtscience** on CRAN, so I want to
be a good curator of that package and keep my niche stuff out of it.
