Things to fix/do in this package:

- compile roto-translation matrices into a list object via code in data-raw....this should make a call to list all the csv files found in a directory which is made specifically for holding these files and nothing else...they should be named by the date they were made for easy lookup. That way the whole thing is self-contained. 

- wrap the multiple mesh processing functions into one with the pipe

- complete volume measurement functions
