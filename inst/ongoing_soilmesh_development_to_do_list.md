Things to fix/do in this package:

- compile roto-translation matrices into a list object via code in data-raw....this should make a call to list all the csv files found in a directory which is made specifically for holding these files and nothing else...they should be named by the date they were made for easy lookup. That way the whole thing is self-contained. 

- make a skeleton Rmd template to to eda for each day with a one-line function call
things the chunking report should include 

~~information about the lamp durations ~~

~~how much water was lost from each specimen~~

~~the actual water contents measured ~~

the actual volume, surface area, DNE, etc metrics that were measured 

A comparison to data previously collected for these particular specimens on previous days 

snapshots of the mesh objects themselves
