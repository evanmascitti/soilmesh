\title{Split the base file name of a mesh scan into atomic idenifiers}
\usage{
parse_mesh_filename(df)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{Data frame containing two columns, 'mesh_file_name', and 'ply_file'}
}
\value{
Data frame containing 11 columns, 10 of which are information about
the scanned specimen and 1 of which is a list-column holding the \verb{"mesh3d'}
objects.
}
\description{
A file naming sheme was developed for this project to ensure all
data files are uniquely identified. Each \code{.ply} file has a unique
identifier containing 9 sepearate pieces of information (see Details). This
function parses the file name into useful metadata about the specimen it
records, and the resulting tibble can be used for anaysis with
\strong{tidyverse} tools.

Each file name contains 9 pieces of information, separated by
underscores. They are (in order of appearance):
\enumerate{
\item \code{inf_mix_number} Overall 3-digit mix number for the main series of
experiments
\item \code{sand_pct} Percent sand-size particles (i.e. > 53 Î¼ sieve
diameter) by oven-dry mass (two digits). Encoded in file name as a percent
(i.e. 55) but converted to a decimal after parsing.
\item \code{sand_name} Unique
camelCase character string which identifies the source of sand, i.e.
"boydMed"
\item \code{clay_name} Unique camelCase character string which identifies the
source of fine-grained soil, i.e. "brownGumbo"
\item \code{rep} Replicate ID for a given mix (A-C)
\item \code{run} Successive date of testing
(1-n)
\item \code{cylinder_ID} The unique number on the aluminum specimen mold used
for the sample (1-12)
\item \code{overall_scan_number} Unique 4-digit number identifying the scan number
(of all the scans I make during the experiment)
\item \code{date_time} Calendar date-time of the scan in POSIX format, i.e.
YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM
}

Note that the percent "clay" (i.e. fines) is not included as an element.
Including this value would be redundant because its value is implicitly
encoded by the sand \%; the "clay \%" i.e.  is simply 1 - sand_pct.
